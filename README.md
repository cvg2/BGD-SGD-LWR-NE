# BGD-SGD-LWR-NE
This repository contains Python implementations of several fundamental machine learning algorithms. The implemented algorithms include:  Batch Gradient Descent (BGD) Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Locally Weighted Regression (LWR) Nearest Neighbor (NE). Locally Weighted Regression has been implemented using SGD and NE.

Each algorithm is implemented from scratch, providing a deeper understanding of its underlying principles and functionality. These implementations can serve as learning resources for those interested in understanding machine learning algorithms or as a reference for incorporating these algorithms into their projects.
